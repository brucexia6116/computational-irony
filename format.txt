The 'main' file (comments.csv) contains:

    subreddit, thread_id, thread_title, comment_id, user, comment, comment_url, parent_comment_id, date

Where parent_comment_id will be an empty string when the entry is a top-level comment (rather than a reply).

In the 'content' subdirectory, we pull the html from the url (above) and name this "content/<thread-id>.html"; we also pull a stripped version ("content/<thread-id>.txt").

And, finally, the users file (users.csv) contains previous posts by users

    user, comment, url, subreddit

Specifically, we record every user's most 50 most recent posts
