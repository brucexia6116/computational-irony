One file (threads.csv) comprises information on the individual threads sampled

    thread_id, subreddit, title, url

In the 'content' subdirectory, we pull the html from the url (above) and name this "content/<thread-id>.html"; we also pull a stripped version ("content/<thread-id>.txt").

Another file (comments.csv) contains:

    thread_id, user, comment, comment_url

And, finally, the users file (users.csv) contains previous posts by users

    user, comment, url, subreddit

Specifically, we record every user's most 50 most recent posts
