2.  The ""third rail"" analogy is that someone in politics is saying something *unpopular* and thus dangerous.  When people talk abotu Social Security being the third rail in politics, they mean ""you touch it, you die.""  As a result, it takes some amount of courage to do it.  A liberal being against free trade takes literally *zero* courage.  It'd be like saying a conservative touched the third rail for being against gay marriage.

* Pays major US telecommunications providers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, et al) between $278,000,000-$394,000,000 annually to provide secret access to all US fiber and cellular networks (in violation of the 4th amendment).

* Made over fifteen thousand false certifications to the secret FISA court, leading a judge to rule they ""frequently and systemically violated"" court orders in a manner ""directly contrary to the sworn attestations of several executive branch officials,"" that **90%** of their searches were unlawful, and that they ""repeatedly misled the court.""

And they spend [$75,000,000,000.00](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/black-budget/) of your tax money each year to do this to you.  I'm not putting up with this any longer.  

Congress just got back into session: call your Congressmen once a day until these programs end.  **I am, and they encourage it, because it gives them a platform to fight on.**  Find yours [HERE](http://www.contactingthecongress.org/), save it to your phone, and make it a 30 second call... just give your information and tell them they need to vote to end these programs immediately so they can report your opposition and the passion of your opposition (the daily call) in their metrics.

We just prevented a war in Syria by calling Congress: calling works.  We can win again here.  6% of the US population reads the front page of Reddit, and 2014 is an election year.  30 seconds, once a day.  Just call: you will end these policies.

And even if they say something... so then they say something, so what? 80% of Americans support us! It's absurd! We have so much support there, and here we're thinking what we should do ""if"".

Fun fact: Lee Hamilton led both the Iran Contra and 9/11 investigations:

&gt;As chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, Hamilton chose not to investigate President Ronald Reagan or President George H. W. Bush, stating that he did not think it would be ""good for the country"" to put the public through another impeachment trial.

Steve J. Rosen, “In the eyes of many, he is AIPAC itself.”

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_J._Rosen

&gt;He was indicted in August 2005 for alleged violations of the Espionage Act in the conduct of AIPAC’s work, but the charges were dropped.

&gt;A major focus of Rosen’s efforts in the 1990s was Iran. Rosen—and his codefendant in the AIPAC/Franklin case Keith Weissman—were among the first to advocate a strategy of graduated American economic sanctions for leverage against ***Iran’s*** alleged involvement in terror and its purported acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities.

&gt;Rosen’s career took a dramatic turn on August 27, 2004, when CBS News broadcast a report alleging that “A spy is working for Israel at the Pentagon… The suspected mole supplied Israel with classified materials…passing classified information…to two men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis...[including] a presidential directive on U.S. policy toward ***Iran***.”

&gt;It was part of the conspiracy that, in an effort to influence persons within and outside the United States government, Rosen and Weissman would cultivate relationships with Franklin and others and would use their contacts within the U.S. government and elsewhere to gather sensitive U.S. government information, including classified information relating to the national defense, for subsequent unlawful communication, delivery and transmission to persons not entitled to receive it.

Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Franklin_espionage_scandal


&gt;The Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal (also known as the AIPAC espionage scandal) refers to Lawrence Franklin's scandal of passing classified documents regarding United States policy towards Iran to Israel through American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Franklin, a former United States Department of Defense employee, pled guilty to several espionage-related charges and was sentenced in January 2006 to nearly 13 years of prison which was later reduced to ten months house arrest. Franklin passed information to AIPAC policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior ***Iran*** analyst Keith Weissman who later were fired by AIPAC. They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel.[1] The case against them eventually was dismissed.[2]


Philip Giraldi, former CIA 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Giraldi

&gt;In 2004 Giraldi, with his partner Vincent Cannistraro, a retired CIA counterterrorism chief, wrote that Turkish sources had reported that Turkey was concerned by Israel's alleged encouragement of Kurdish ambitions to create an independent state and that Israeli intelligence operations in the area included anti-Syrian and ***anti-Iranian activity*** by Kurds. They predicted this might lead to a new alliance among ***Iran***, Syria, and Turkey which have Kurdish minorities.[6]

&gt;In August 2005, Giraldi wrote that US Vice President Dick Cheney had instructed STRATCOM to prepare ""a contingency plan to be employed in response to another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States... [including] a large-scale air assault on ***Iran*** employing both conventional and tactical nuclear weapons... not conditional on ***Iran*** actually being involved in the act of terrorism directed against the United States."" The reason cited for the attack to use mini-nukes is that the targets are hardened or are deep underground and would not be destroyed by non-nuclear warheads.[7][8]

&gt;In 2005 Giraldi also wrote that the Italian Niger/yellowcake documents claiming an Iraqi interest in purchasing uranium from Niger were forgeries created by former CIA officers and Michael Ledeen. (See Niger uranium forgeries.) Giraldi also wrote that officials in the Office of Special Plans working for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith had forged the ""Habbush letter"" allegedly written by Saddam Hussein's intelligence director regarding shipping the uranium.[9][10]

&gt;In 2009 Giraldi wrote that unnamed intelligence sources had told him that a document published by The Times, which allegedly described an ***Iranian*** plan to experiment on a ""neutron initiator"" for an atomic weapon, was in fact a fabrication, which Giraldi speculated was created by the state of Israel. He claimed that Rupert Murdoch publications regularly published false intelligence from the Israeli and sometimes the British government.[9][11] Further disclosures by The Times undermined the document's veracity.[12]

&gt;In August, 2010 Giraldi wrote that unnamed “sources in the counterintelligence community” had told him that agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were posing as intelligence agents and visiting Arabs and Muslims in New York and New Jersey. This was allegedly done to help agents gain information about ***Iran***, which they believed would not be forthcoming to known Israeli agents.

When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated;""

It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor, both black and white, through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything on a society gone mad on war. And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic, destructive suction tube.

* Had James Clapper lie under oath to us - on camera - to Congress to hide the domestic spying programs [Occured in March, revealed in June](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/350699/clappers-lie-charles-c-w-cooke).  

* Warrantlessly accesses records of every phone call that routes through the US thousands of times a day [June] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order)[September] (http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/nsa-broke-rules-call-tracking-96571.html)

* Steals your private data from every major web company (Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, et al) via PRISM[June] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data) and pays them millions for it [August] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/nsa-prism-costs-tech-companies-paid)

* Pays major US telecommunications providers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, et al) between $278,000,000-$394,000,000 annually to provide secret access to all US fiber and cellular networks (in violation of the 4th amendment).

* Made over fifteen thousand false certifications to the secret FISA court, leading a judge to rule they ""frequently and systemically violated"" court orders in a manner ""directly contrary to the sworn attestations of several executive branch officials,"" that **90%** of their searches were unlawful, and that they ""repeatedly misled the court.""

Congress just got back into session: call your Congressmen once a day until these programs end.  **I am, and they encourage it, because it gives them a platform to fight on.**  Find yours [HERE](http://www.contactingthecongress.org/), save it to your phone, and make it a 30 second call... just give your information and tell them they need to vote to end these programs immediately so they can report your opposition and the passion of your opposition (the daily call) in their metrics.

We just prevented a war in Syria by calling Congress: calling works.  We can win again here.  6% of the US population reads the front page of Reddit, and 2014 is an election year.  30 seconds, once a day.  Just call: you will end these policies.

It matters what *HR departments* say.  

If HR sets a requirement that X position has a requirement of Y degree, then you are will not pass to the level of even getting interviewed if you don't fulfill those requirements... even if you know how to do the job.  

It's that simple.  

There is also the issue of completely bogus requirements.  We've all seen want ads that *require* 5 years experience in some software package that only came out last year.  Or needing 10+ years of experience in a certain field that moves so fast that anything past a couple of years experience is too old to really be worth anything.  Yet HR departments continue to ask for shit like this... and continue to reject perfectly qualified candidates for no good reason.

The *biggest* problem comes though, when the same companies that require Y degree are then not willing to *pay* for it.  That is the biggest kicker.  They pawn off all the time and expense onto individuals to get a certain level of education, but then aren't willing to pay more than someone with just a HS diploma or possibly a certificate.

politics,1m8svu,The IRS is cracking down on tips – again. Why go after billionaires when you can squeeze more out of servers?,cc6wv2x,renata322,"So, this is the way it works, I worked for ADP for some time and learned a lot about minimum tip wage. Obviously as everyone knows, different states have different minimum wages and different laws.As everyone should also know, there is also a federal minimum tip wage. 

The article, like most, didn't state this: if a server doesn't get enough tips to reach the state minimum wage (not minimum tip wage), then their base pay will be increased that one night (or however many nights the tips dont reach min wage) to meet the minimum wage. 

So for example: If I make $2.75/hour and I worked 4 hours that would mean I made a base of $11. If the state minimum wage is 8.25/hour, then I should have made a total of $35. Lets say I got a total of $20 in tips... This would bring my total for the night to $31. This doesn't meet the state minimum wage. The employer would have to raise the hourly amount to meet their gross to be at least $35 total since thats what the state min wage would total gross for 4 hours worked....

When I dealt with ADP clients that had restaurants, they reported their employees tips. The reason why they do this is because the employer needs to report a certain percentage of tips they earned and it needs to meet a minimum tip earnings. I forgot whether it's per month or annually. Lets say that the required minimum tip percentage earnings reported for a month are 8% of the total income the restaurant earned in a month. If the restaurant made $100,000 in that month, the restaurant would have to show at least $8000 in tips. 

Since a lot of people tip by credit card, it's much easier to go through the earnings and see which earnings are tips and which aren't. If it's a small business, def tip in cash, most employers only report the bare minimum the IRS requires them to report to keep their employees happy and to keep the business with profits.

Why go after billionaires when you can squeeze more out of servers?,cc6wud6,wraith313,"For people who havn't been waiters, and don't know about this law: If a waiter gets paid $2 an hour base, and that waiter doesn't make up the difference in that $2 and *at least* minimum wage, then the business has to front the rest of the money to bring it up to a minimum wage average over their hours. So if they work 10 hours and only make $20, the company is obligated legally to make up the difference in that $20 and the amount they would have made with minimum wage base pay. Link at bottom of post.

Like it or not, and I have been a waiter so I know this is true, a lot of waiters *love* to complain about tips even though the problem isn't that serious. Any waiter worth their salt will be able to make, at any restaurant that has moderate foot traffic, well over minimum wage on average. The ones who don't, I have found through personal experience, are either lazy (don't want to refill drinks, leave customers hanging around waiting for checks, etc) or they just aren't good at their job (not everyone is cut out for that line of work). Tips and gratuity are supposed to be based on service. They are not supposed to be mandatory. Do people abuse this occasionally? yeah. But the vast majority don't. The vast majority will drop 20% on that line regardless of the service they got. A lot of waiters *abuse* that fact and do less work, expecting they will get the tip regardless. A lot of times they *will* get it regardless.

I guess the bottom line is, waiters and waitresses have nothing to complain about. Everyone has to pay taxes. That's just how it is. Why should waiters and waitresses be excused from that? If that was the case, every service industry should start working on a ""tip"" basis just to get out of having to pay taxes. 

I am fully expecting to be downvoted for this opinion. But not everyone is a starving single mother of two who is putting their way through graduate school while working at dennys. A lot of waiters and waitresses aren't bad people, they just think they have some inherent right or privilege because they are taking your order. In a perfect world, they would *have* to split their tips with the cooks in a lot of places. Why? because a lot of times, people will tip based on the quality of their food as well, and that has *nothing* to do with who sets it down on your table. Or how about when you order a mixed drink from your table? The bartender makes it. He doesn't see much of that tip (most places he sees exactly none of it). 

Sources: I have worked in the industry as a waiter, cook, and bartender.

Edit: source for anyone who cares about the law.  I would really like to note: a lot of people in the US have this insane false perception about how waiters get paid. The fact of the matter is, they *arent* going to starve if they get $0 tips. In fact, they will make out exactly the same as everyone else working entry level jobs. You hear this all the time: ""Tips are how they make their money. We *have* to tip"". Someone usually says this when you get a particularly bad waiter/waitress and would rather not even tip at all. That statement is *wrong*. They will get paid regardless. And tipping is *supposed* to be based on *service* received.

I agree that hard work can cause upward mobility, I believe that you make your own opportunities in life but I see all the time that the opportunities that are available have become more rare.  So more people are competing for fewer chances at success and this divide is just getting bigger.   It took a lot of hard work but I went from poverty growing up to a very successful career but I worry that my children will be suck with enormous debt from schooling and be destined to a middle of the road job as a result.  I'm an optimist at heart so I think that we can fix this before it happens through better financial regulation that prevents companies from practices such as hording profits, huge bonuses for CEOs, and tax loopholes.

What if I told you a middle of the road job didn't have to be something bad, and shouldn't be?

Look at a country like Norway. Their income distribution is far flatter than ours. They have free higher education, free healthcare and a national pension that is paid for with oil profits (because they nationalized their oil reserves). If you made a middle of the road living in Norway, you would live a comfortable life.

The US isn't interested in that because here it is all about privatizing everything and ""competition"" which isn't really competition anyway.

These are the people effecting the lives of the rest of the population. I think the downfall of America starts here, because they will look out for their own interests.

This is the funniest bit, and being a bit slow on the uptake, I needed to think about it for a minute, and re-read the link.

If US comms are sucked up, then Israel gets to wiretap American government officials for free.  They are undoubtedly filtering the data we give them for intel, positions, and blackmail material on the the US government.

Really, dismantling these organizations is the only option we have. But the last president that actually had the will to do something like that was driven slowly into a kill zone in Dallas. 

We can no longer rearrange the deck chairs on this sinking ship. We must destroy and rebuild the parts that we would like to keep and leave destroyed those parts which have caused us and the world nothing but shit like the NSA, CIA, NRO, in fact it is easier to list the agency we should keep to secure our protection: the military. If it is an alphabet agency it should be dismantled. 

Also, no amount of calls stopped us from attacking Syria, Kerry slipping up and giving them a peaceful option stopped us.  Obama wants to bomb them because it is part of the long term strat( which strangely comes from PNAC). There is a piece at globalresearch.ca which details the military assests being put into place to strike syria before the gas attack happened. They were just looking for or waiting for an excuse( which is interesting considering the recently hacked emails about this very thing)

&gt;The main thing is, first of all, to strike them, not once but several times, so painfully that the price they pay will be unbearable. So far, the price tag is not unbearable. I mean a large scale attack on the Palestinian Authority, causing them to fear that everything is about to collapse. Fear is what brings them to... 

Q: Won't the world see us as aggressors? 

&gt;Especially today, with the US. I know how they are. America is something that you can easily maneuver and move in the right direction. And even if they say something... so then they say something, so what? 80% of Americans support us! It's absurd! We have so much support there, and here we're thinking what we should do ""if"". Look, I wasn't afraid to maneuver [the Clinton Administration], I wasn't afraid to confront Clinton. I wasn't afraid to go against the UN.

Fun fact: Lee Hamilton led both the Iran Contra and 9/11 investigations:

&gt;As chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, Hamilton chose not to investigate President Ronald Reagan or President George H. W. Bush, stating that he did not think it would be ""good for the country"" to put the public through another impeachment trial.

Steve J. Rosen, “In the eyes of many, he is AIPAC itself.”

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_J._Rosen

&gt;He was indicted in August 2005 for alleged violations of the Espionage Act in the conduct of AIPAC’s work, but the charges were dropped.

&gt;A major focus of Rosen’s efforts in the 1990s was Iran. Rosen—and his codefendant in the AIPAC/Franklin case Keith Weissman—were among the first to advocate a strategy of graduated American economic sanctions for leverage against ***Iran’s*** alleged involvement in terror and its purported acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities.

&gt;Rosen’s career took a dramatic turn on August 27, 2004, when CBS News broadcast a report alleging that “A spy is working for Israel at the Pentagon… The suspected mole supplied Israel with classified materials…passing classified information…to two men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis...[including] a presidential directive on U.S. policy toward ***Iran***.”

&gt;It was part of the conspiracy that, in an effort to influence persons within and outside the United States government, Rosen and Weissman would cultivate relationships with Franklin and others and would use their contacts within the U.S. government and elsewhere to gather sensitive U.S. government information, including classified information relating to the national defense, for subsequent unlawful communication, delivery and transmission to persons not entitled to receive it.

Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Franklin_espionage_scandal


&gt;The Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal (also known as the AIPAC espionage scandal) refers to Lawrence Franklin's scandal of passing classified documents regarding United States policy towards Iran to Israel through American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Franklin, a former United States Department of Defense employee, pled guilty to several espionage-related charges and was sentenced in January 2006 to nearly 13 years of prison which was later reduced to ten months house arrest. Franklin passed information to AIPAC policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior ***Iran*** analyst Keith Weissman who later were fired by AIPAC. They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel.[1] The case against them eventually was dismissed.[2]


Philip Giraldi, former CIA 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Giraldi

&gt;In 2004 Giraldi, with his partner Vincent Cannistraro, a retired CIA counterterrorism chief, wrote that Turkish sources had reported that Turkey was concerned by Israel's alleged encouragement of Kurdish ambitions to create an independent state and that Israeli intelligence operations in the area included anti-Syrian and ***anti-Iranian activity*** by Kurds. They predicted this might lead to a new alliance among ***Iran***, Syria, and Turkey which have Kurdish minorities.[6]

&gt;In August 2005, Giraldi wrote that US Vice President Dick Cheney had instructed STRATCOM to prepare ""a contingency plan to be employed in response to another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States... [including] a large-scale air assault on ***Iran*** employing both conventional and tactical nuclear weapons... not conditional on ***Iran*** actually being involved in the act of terrorism directed against the United States."" The reason cited for the attack to use mini-nukes is that the targets are hardened or are deep underground and would not be destroyed by non-nuclear warheads.[7][8]

&gt;In 2005 Giraldi also wrote that the Italian Niger/yellowcake documents claiming an Iraqi interest in purchasing uranium from Niger were forgeries created by former CIA officers and Michael Ledeen. (See Niger uranium forgeries.) Giraldi also wrote that officials in the Office of Special Plans working for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith had forged the ""Habbush letter"" allegedly written by Saddam Hussein's intelligence director regarding shipping the uranium.[9][10]

&gt;In 2009 Giraldi wrote that unnamed intelligence sources had told him that a document published by The Times, which allegedly described an ***Iranian*** plan to experiment on a ""neutron initiator"" for an atomic weapon, was in fact a fabrication, which Giraldi speculated was created by the state of Israel. He claimed that Rupert Murdoch publications regularly published false intelligence from the Israeli and sometimes the British government.[9][11] Further disclosures by The Times undermined the document's veracity.[12]

&gt;In August, 2010 Giraldi wrote that unnamed “sources in the counterintelligence community” had told him that agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were posing as intelligence agents and visiting Arabs and Muslims in New York and New Jersey. This was allegedly done to help agents gain information about ***Iran***, which they believed would not be forthcoming to known Israeli agents.

&gt;If a biotech crop has already been approved (or deregulated) by the USDA and a court reverses that approval, the provision directs the Secretary of Agriculture to grant temporary deregulation status at the request of a grower or seed producer, to allow growers to continue the cultivation of the crop while legal challenges to the safety of those crops are underway  
  
It doesn't actually directly affect Biotech companies, it's more designed to protect farmers in the case that a particularly seed variety has its approval revoked after the crops are in the ground.  At their discretion, a farmer can keep growing the crop with the hope that it will be re-approved by the time it's ready for harvest.  Is that really so insidious?  
  
My understanding is that pretty much any legal challenge, no matter how baseless, can result in temporary revocation of FDA approval.  There's no reason a farmer should have to immediately destroy their crop because bunk science / fear-mongering caused the FDA to act in an over-cautionary manner.  Especially if the legal challenge is expected to be resolved in pretty short order.

Additionally, calling it the ""Monsanto Protection Act"" is akin to using the phrase ""Obamacare"".  It's not the name of the act, and the nickname is only used to fuel dissent.  Obamacare is really the Health and Affordable Care Act, and this is really the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act.

This act does protect Monsanto's clients and in turn protects Monsanto. What this does is allows farmers to purchase their products, grow them, and then not have to worry about tearing up their fields later because the farmers themselves know their products (particularly the way they are grown) is detrimental to the environment.

It allows farmers to recklessly use Monsanto's products and if something bad is found then they don't have to pay the price. In other words it's like an insurance plan. 

This does not effect smaller farms in the same way it does industrial farms. Industrial farms are the ones that do the most polluting, use GMO's the most, and have the most and to gain from having this bill passed.

Second, we've been changing the genes of crops for centuries. Every time we crossbred a crop via pollination, we change the genes a bit. Genetically modifying it just speeds up and allows for more precision in the gene rearranging.

Third, while I can't speak as to whether the motivation is profit based or not, I do know that. GMOs generally have higher crop density and more resistance to disease and insects. This allows for more food in less space, allowing for farmers to get more out of their fields without having to cut down forests for more farmland.

Fourth, splicing is not the only way we modify genes of plants. Like I said, crossbreading via pollination is a form of genetically modifying our food. This creates a problem with what foods will be considered GMOs.

Fifth, basically no crops we use are as they originally were ""untouched by man"" if you will. It's not efficient. We can have less deforestation and curb starvation in the world. Look up Norman Borlaug (I think that's how you spell his name). He won a nobel prize for saving an estimated 2 billion lives by going to countries with shitty crop conditions and helping the people there by providing the correct seeds for GMO plants that would thrive there.

Sixth, with completely organic methods, we could feed only 2/3 of the population of earth. Anyone wanna volunteer to be in that 1/3 who gets left hungry?

Seventh, GMOs have to go through rigorous testing to be sold.

Eigth, because of stigmatization of GMOs, could.tries have turned down GMOs because of organizations like Green Peace telling them that the seeds they were getting was poison. That's simply not true and fear mongering.

Obviously she should have disclosed ties, but I don't see how that invalidates her reporting.  If anything, those ties are necessary to actually get on the ground and maintain the kinds of contacts she's been able to build in the Syrian rebels.  
  
It certainly tarnishes her reputation, but I'd be interested in hearing anyone actually able to provide a substantive refutation of her read of the situation on the ground.  People have been very insistent that al Nusra is some kind of big significant part of the rebel forces, but I've never seen evidence of that being true.  People seem to take for granted that just because radical elements seized power in Egypt, the same tactics would get them power in Syria (never mind the same tactics **didn't work** in Libya).

But in the past year or so, he seems obsessed with the wrong parts of our nation and culture.

Yes, we're a nation that's has almost *always* been at war. That was a fact of life in America *before* 9/11 and you'd think Chomsky could fit that reality into modern day life. He's acting like we're a country that just figured out how to attack other nations and that Obama is the most aggressive American leader in history.

Hyperbole in the worst way.

Obama hasn't issued *attacks* or started any *new* wars. He inherited war(S). And as much as people hate to hear it, you cannot just withdrawal them all and pretend they didn't happen.

Obama *did* issue the command for the troops to come home from Iraq. And he did campaign on the idea of staying in Afghanistan to finish what Bush unfortunately started. Obama was the commander in chief whenever Bin Laden was brought to justice, which was supposedly the point of these wars and conflicts.

So now Obama is the fucking evil dictator hellbent on war? 

After bringing home troops from Iraq and accomplishing what Bush was incapable of accomplishing? And after *not* starting wars since he's been in office? He could have started war with Iran...fuck knows the republicans wanted war with Iran. He didn't. He could have started wars in pretty much *any* middle eastern country but he hasn't.

Sadly, these things are the truth...and Chomsky is going off the deep end without doubt here, which is sad to see given the insight he usually has on politics and culture.

He needs to refocus on life in America, the way corporations have taken over the government, how banks have taken over the world, how the middle class has been purposefully slaughtered, how this nation is sinking in debt and we have less equality financially since we've had since the 1920s.

Nope...instead, he wants to focus on taking pot shots at Obama for whatever reason and make him out to be some warmonger (who hasn't even started any new wars.)
