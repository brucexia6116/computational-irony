KUSA- Denver police defended their decision to stand down while dozens of
people smoked marijuana at Monday's pot giveaway in Civic Center Park. Police
said they did not want to start a riot over a petty offense. Hundreds of
people lined up to get free pot during the event organized by the opponents of
a statewide ballot question over taxing retail marijuana. The measure asks
voters to approve a 15 percent excise tax along with a 10 percent statewide
sales tax on all retail marijuana purchases. (KUSA-TV Â© 2013 Multimedia
