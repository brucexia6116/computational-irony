HarryBridges,What have you written that was not hateful and childish?  What intelligent arguments have you made?  There is nothing that you've accused me of that you did not do first and more extensively.,politics,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1lsp0v/conservatives_are_unembarrassed_by_a_history_of/cc2vlcr
HarryBridges,"Some sound stage work on TG,tB&amp;tU was done at Cinnecita in Rome but almost all of it was filmed in the province of Almeria in southern Spain.

Most of the great spaghetti westerns were filmed in Almeria.",funny,http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ltmid/my_favorite_line_from_the_james_franco_roast/cc2s8s7

moxy800,"It's really strange that as beloved as Greek mythology has been over he centuries, nobody has really seriously taken that on in film.

I have seen a handful of very good adaptions of greek tragedies (plays) on PBS in the 70's and 80's. There are a couple of good Greek film versions of the tragedies (I vaguely remember [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076208/) being good.

The Disney Hercules isn't BAD but its not taking the mythology very seriously either.",movies,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltjb2/what_is_your_dream_film_adaptation/cc2s9jq
