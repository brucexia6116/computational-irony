That said you typically just boil dungeness and then crack them up and eat the meat hot with melted butter - others have already said that.  Now that you've got cold, picked over crab meat, I'd look online for some kind of a Crab Louis recipe or maybe just a crab salad (think like chicken salad, on nice toasted bread with fresh tomatoes, lettuce and maybe cukes - an elegant sandwich to be sure).

HarryBridges,"I've told this story on Reddit before, but...

About 20 years ago I went to my uncle's house for dinner.  Me, my uncle, my aunt and my little cousin were there.  Had a nice green salad, rice, a nice pot of beans and a tomato based sauce like a cacciatore.  Now ""alla cacciatore"" is Italian for ""hunter's style"" which this literally was: it was the game my uncle had shot the day before on his hunting trip cooked with tomatoes, onions, peppers, spices, etc - all served over rice.

I asked my uncle what was in the stew and he'd shot a grouse (or it might have been a quail or doves - can't exactly remember), a rabbit, and ""something else, I don't know what it was.""  I kind of wanted to know more but all he could say was ""It was some kind of animal I'd never seen before - really peculiar looking - so I shot it to get a better look at it.""  So what did closer inspection of the corpse show?  ""I have no idea, it wasn't like anything I've ever seen.""  So he skinned it and stewed it up for his nephew the next day.

So basically I ate ""mystery meat.""

And, no, it was not nutria.

And it was a pretty good meal.",food,http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1lmypo/whats_the_most_exotic_food_you_have_tried_would/cc1czfx

It's nice, bright technicolor - no B&amp;W if that's an issue.  And it was filmed on location in the Sudan before the dams were put up on the Nile, so when they have the scenes of thousands of Egyptians hauling the British boats upstream into the rapids - that's exactly what you're looking at - no CGI or other trickery.

About 20 years ago I went to my uncle's house for dinner.  Me, my uncle, my aunt and my little cousin were there.  Had a nice green salad, rice, a nice pot of beans and a tomato based sauce like a cacciatore.  Now ""alla cacciatore"" is Italian for ""hunter's style"" which this literally was: it was the game my uncle had shot the day before on his hunting trip cooked with tomatoes, onions, peppers, spices, etc - all served over rice.

I asked my uncle what was in the stew and he'd shot a grouse (or it might have been a quail or doves - can't exactly remember), a rabbit, and ""something else, I don't know what it was.""  I kind of wanted to know more but all he could say was ""It was some kind of animal I'd never seen before - really peculiar looking - so I shot it to get a better look at it.""  So what did closer inspection of the corpse show?  ""I have no idea, it wasn't like anything I've ever seen.""  So he skinned it and stewed it up for his nephew the next day.

So basically I ate ""mystery meat.""

And, no, it was not nutria.

As someone who has no head at all for that sort of thing, it's beyond my abilities to answer that with specifics.

But I new a lady who died in her 80's around 2005 who lived VERY modestly in a small ranch house in Alabama who turned maybe about 600,000 left to her by her husband into about 4 or 5  million dollars through investing by the time she died. BTW she was only educated up to High School.

She watched stock market reports every day for a couple of hours, read the local paper. She had a broker but still did a lot of her own thinking on what to buy. It's unbelievable how many of her stocks ended up splitting, some more than once.

I say she was 'savvy' because I am sure in the same time period, lots of people lost their shirts.

For all that, I still think a great part of this lady's success was her luck in being in the market at the 'right' time.  I doubt she'd have done so well today.",politics,http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1lte3i/matt_taibbi_rolling_stone_has_since_learned_that/cc2rtpu

moxy800,"It won't be possible in all occasions, but one thing I learned working in hot shops with no A/C, just getting a cotton rag wet and putting it around your neck can work wonders. As it gets warm you can just swish it through the air to cool it off and eventually re-wet it and start the process all over again.",Frugal,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1lqjjh/keeping_cool_without_ac_request/cc2170l
moxy800,"The eyeglasses are a great deal compared to other places I've seen, but am not overall impressed with the prices on  most things - though have found a few decent deals on rare occasions.

Ont thing that bugs me about the store is all the excessive plastic packaging used to bundle more than one thing together. It certainly isn't environmentally friendly.",Frugal,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1lqeig/is_a_costco_membership_worth_it_i_was_walking/cc214hu

moxy800,"The only ""War and Peace"" I really like was done by the BBC as a mini-series in I think the 70's - Anthony Hopkins made a GREAT Pierre and for me it is still my favorite performance of his.

Don't know if it was ever released on DVD though.

EDIT: Hey - at least some episodes are on youtube. As per the usual of that eras, production values are not that high, but terrific acting and re-watching the first 20 minutes i think it does capture Tolstoy pretty well

moxy800,"Herzog's [The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071691/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is AMAZING

I was a very big fan of [Bright Star](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810784/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) based on the real life of John Keats. Why this film didn't get more attention is beyond my comprehension.

I actually think the Hollywood ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" with Clark Gable and Charles Laughton is a great film. and a little underrated.

There are some weak elements to the version of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" with Ronald Colman but HE is so great it makes up for anything else.

There are quite  a few versions of Les Miserables but  IMO the only really great one is the 1934 version by Raymond Bernard starring Harry Baur.

It's not Europe and the time period may be a little later than 1820 (think its around 1840)  but ""The Heiress"" is a great film.

I'll add another vote to the pro-Barry Lyndon pile.

[Tom Jones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057590/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) used to be super-famous. Interesting its kind of fallen out of people's memory.

[Start the Revolution Without Me](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066402/?ref_=sr_1), set in the French Revolution  is hilarious and very Monty Python-esque before there was a Monty Python.
